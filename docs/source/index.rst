Grond
=====

A probabilistic earthquake source inversion framework. Designed and crafted in Mordor.

Abstract
--------

Grond is an open source software tool for robust characterization of earthquake sources. Moment tensors and finite fault rupture models can be estimated from a combination of seismic waveforms, waveform attributes and geodetic observations like InSAR and GNSS. It helps you to investigate diverse magmatic, tectonic, and other geophysical processes at all scales.

It delivers meaningful model uncertainties through a Bayesian bootstrap-based probabilistic joint inversion scheme. The optimisation explores the full model space and maps model parameter trade-offs with a flexible design of objective functions.

Rapid forward modelling is enabled by using pre-computed Green's function databases, handled through the Pyrocko software library. They serve synthetic near-field surface displacements and synthetic seismic waveforms for arbitrary earthquake source models and geometries.
